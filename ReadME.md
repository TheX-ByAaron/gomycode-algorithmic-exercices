# Algorithms exercise set 🧮🧮🧮
### 🌟 This set of exercises is to help the students with the logical process of solving common problems. 
### 🌟 With these exercises you will develop a logical sense of algorithmic thinking.
### 🌟 Exercises that have the following emoji 🦋 are simple and anyone should be able to solve them.
### 🌟 Exercises that have the following emoji 🤖 are harder than the previous ones but you still can solve them with some effort.
### 🌟 Exercises that have the following emoji 👾 are a bit more complex than the other ones. So if you solve them then you should be proud of yourself 😎

# Exercise 1 🦋
```json
- Given a string that contains vowels, create an algorithm that counts the number of vowels in a string.
- The vowels are : A, E, I, O, U, Y
- An example of what the algorithm should do :
    
    Input : "Have a good day"
    Output : 7
```
<br>

# Exercise 2 🦋
```json
- Given a string with multiple words. a word is separated by a space.
- Create an algorithm that counts the number of words in a sentence.
- An example of what an algorithm should do : 

    Input : "Today was a good day."
    Output : 5
```

<br>

# Exercise 3 🦋
```json 
- Given a string, Create an algorithm that takes a string and two characters at the begining, and then replaces the first character with the second inside the string.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :

    Input : "Hpllo mikpy" , "p" , "e"
    Output : "Hello mikey"
```

<br>

# Exercise 4 🦋
```json 
- Imagine that you can't use simple multiplication "*" in algorithms. Create an algorithm that does the multiplication of two numbers using the addition instead.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :
    
    Input : 5, 6
    Output : 30
```

<br>

# Exercise 5 🦋
```json 
- Create an algorithm that takes a number and calculates its power with a second input number.
- A power is the number of successive multiplications of a number. For example '2  power 3' means '2*2*2' which gives us '8'.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :

    Input : 3, 4
    Output : 81
