# Algorithms exercise set ðŸ§®ðŸ§®ðŸ§®
### ðŸŒŸ This set of exercises is to help the students with the logical process of solving common problems. 
### ðŸŒŸ With these exercises you will develop a logical sense of algorithmic thinking.
### ðŸŒŸ Exercises that have the following emoji ðŸ¦‹ are simple and anyone should be able to solve them.
### ðŸŒŸ Exercises that have the following emoji ðŸ¤– are harder than the previous ones but you still can solve them with some effort.
### ðŸŒŸ Exercises that have the following emoji ðŸ‘¾ are a bit more complex than the other ones. So if you solve them then you should be proud of yourself ðŸ˜Ž

# Exercise 1 ðŸ¦‹
```
- Given a string that contains vowels, create an algorithm that counts the number of vowels in a string.
- The vowels are : A, E, I, O, U, Y
- An example of what the algorithm should do :
    
    Input : "Have a good day"
    Output : 7
```
<br>

# Exercise 2 ðŸ¦‹
```
- Given a string with multiple words. a word is separated by a space.
- Create an algorithm that counts the number of words in a sentence.
- An example of what an algorithm should do : 

    Input : "Today was a good day."
    Output : 5
```

<br>

# Exercise 3 ðŸ¦‹
```
- Given a string, Create an algorithm that takes a string and two characters at the begining, and 
then replaces the first character with the second inside the string.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :

    Input : "Hpllo mikpy" , "p" , "e"
    Output : "Hello mikey"
```

<br>

# Exercise 4 ðŸ¦‹
```
- Imagine that you can't use simple multiplication "*" in algorithms. Create an algorithm that does the 
multiplication of two numbers using the addition instead.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :
    
    Input : 5, 6
    Output : 30
```

<br>

# Exercise 5 ðŸ¦‹
```
- Create an algorithm that takes a number and calculates its power with a second input number.
- A power is the number of successive multiplications of a number. For example '2  power 3' means 
'2*2*2' which gives us '8'.
- An example of what the algorithm should do :

    Input : 3, 4
    Output : 81
